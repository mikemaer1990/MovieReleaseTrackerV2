# Top-Releases Optimization Plan

## Current State Analysis

The top-releases page currently has **significant performance limitations**:
- Only 3-8 pages fetched (vs 25+ for upcoming) = limited movie selection
- No smart caching system = every request hits TMDB APIs fresh
- Traditional pagination without pre-warming
- Same API sorting issues we fixed for upcoming movies
- Rate limiting issues due to frequent TMDB calls

## Current Implementation Details

### Route: `/routes/top-releases.js`
- Fetches 3 pages (8 with genre filtering)
- Uses `while` loop to accumulate movies
- Direct TMDB API calls with no caching
- Limited to ~60-160 movies maximum

### Load-More: `/routes/api/load-more.js` (load-more-releases)
- Re-fetches from scratch for each pagination request
- No pre-warming or caching
- Limited to 5 additional pages per request

## Proposed Solution: Extend MoviePaginationService

### Phase 1: Add Top-Releases Support to MoviePaginationService
- Extend the existing sophisticated caching system to handle "releases" type movies
- Add `getReleasesSortedPage()` method alongside existing upcoming methods
- Implement pre-warming for popular streaming releases

### Phase 2: Smart Caching for Top-Releases
- Pre-warm popularity cache for top streaming releases (same 100 movies, 5 batches of 20)
- Cache date-sorted collections for "newest" and "rating" sorts
- Use same unified filtering pipeline for consistency

### Phase 3: Enhanced Movie Volume
- Increase from 3-8 pages to 25+ pages for comprehensive movie selection
- Better date range coverage (6 months of streaming releases)
- Improved filtering for streaming/digital release types

### Phase 4: Integration & Performance
- Integrate top-releases route with MoviePaginationService
- Update load-more-releases endpoint to use cached collections
- Maintain same API but with instant performance

## Expected Results
- **Performance**: Popularity sorting becomes instant (cached)
- **Volume**: 3-5x more movies available (25+ pages vs 3-8)
- **Consistency**: Same filtering logic as upcoming movies
- **User Experience**: No more waiting for TMDB API calls

## Implementation Status
- [x] Phase 1: Extend MoviePaginationService for releases
  - [x] Added discoverMovies import and toUtcMidnight helper
  - [x] Created fetchStreamingReleases method for releases-specific API calls
  - [x] Added getReleasesSortedPage method with caching support
  - [x] Implemented releases cache infrastructure to constructor
- [x] Phase 2: Implement smart caching
  - [x] Added warmReleasesPopularityCache method with target-based fetching (100 movies in 5 batches of 20)
  - [x] Integrated releases cache warming into preloadCollections function
  - [x] Added automatic cache warming on cache miss/stale detection
  - [x] Created getQuickReleasesPopularityResponse fallback method
- [x] Phase 3: Increase movie volume
  - [x] Extended from 3-8 pages to 25+ pages capability via pagination service
  - [x] Enhanced date range coverage (6 months of streaming releases)
  - [x] Improved filtering for streaming/digital release types
- [x] Phase 4: Integration and testing
  - [x] Updated top-releases route to use MoviePaginationService
    - [x] Replaced complex 3-8 page fetching with single getReleasesSortedPage call
    - [x] Added moviePaginationService import and integration
    - [x] Updated render template to use pagination metadata
  - [x] Updated load-more-releases endpoint to use cached collections
    - [x] Replaced manual API calls with getReleasesSortedPage service
    - [x] Added displayedMovieIds support for proper deduplication
    - [x] Enhanced response with pagination metadata (totalCount, collectionSize, source)
  - [x] Test performance improvements and verify functionality
    - [x] Fixed async filtering bug causing rate limiting issues
    - [x] Server starts successfully with both cache warming systems
    - [x] No more rate limiting during startup
    - [x] All optimization phases completed successfully

## Success Criteria from Upcoming Movies Fix
Based on the successful upcoming movies optimization:
- ✅ Fixed TMDB API sorting issues
- ✅ Increased from 8 to 25+ pages
- ✅ Enhanced date sorting logic
- ✅ Verified 6-month coverage
- ✅ Smart caching with instant performance

This would bring top-releases to the same performance level as the newly optimized upcoming movies page!
